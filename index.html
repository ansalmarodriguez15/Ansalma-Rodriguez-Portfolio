                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Hello! I'm Jorge Urdaneta, a Venezuelan-born mechanical engineer at UT driven by curiosity, challenge, and impact. Moving to the U.S. at 15, I've navigated cultures, led student organizations, managed projects, and I'm building an autonomous flying ATV. My mindset is to always try to grow and find a way to give back.</p>
                    <p>My passion is robotics: designing autonomous systems that make life easier, safer, and better for people. Whether that is in the shape of a car that keeps you safe, or a humanoid that assists you, I want to be the one to build it and change someone's life.</p>
                    <p>I pursue every project with purpose, grateful for the doors the world has opened for me throughout my path. I'm determined to repay the generosity and kidness of the world through meaningful innovation that will impact lives for ages.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Outside of academics, leading, and robotics, I'm passionate about exploring the world and expressing myself creatively. I enjoy soccer, hiking, trying new foods, travelling, fashion, and painting shoes. I'm always looking for ways to combine style, culture, and expressing myself.</p>
                    <p>I truly believe personality can take you a long way.</p>

    <h2>Inspection Tool for 777X Heads-Up Display (HUD)</h2>

        <span class="tag">Design for Manufacturing (DFM)</span>
    </div>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      During my internship at Boeing, I was assigned to design an <strong>inspection tool</strong> for the installation
      template of the <strong>777X Heads-Up Display (HUD)</strong>. While the specific engineering drawing and tolerances are confidential,
      the overall goal was to develop a system that verified the accuracy of the HUD’s hard-point alignment. This is a critical factor
      for ensuring proper optical projection and accuracy of the runway highlight feature.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      The HUD installation template includes several <strong>hard points</strong> that must remain within extremely tight tolerances,
      with the smallest allowable deviation being in the single digits of a thousandth of an inch.. My task was to create an inspection
      tool capable of detecting when any of those points were out of tolerance, without relying on complex or time-consuming CMM procedures.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p>
      I approached the problem by designing a <strong>three-part inspection assembly</strong> that would interface directly
      with the existing hard points. The concept was based on laser alignment: one component housed a precision laser source,
      while the other two featured machined holes positioned parallel to each reference point.
    </p>

    <p>
      In operation, the laser would pass cleanly through both holes if the points were within tolerance. If even slightly out
      of alignment, the beam would begin to clip the edge, which would show a visual indicator of deviation. Complete blockage indicated a
      critical out-of-tolerance condition requiring CMM verification and most likely a rework. This simple optical logic provided a
      <strong>non-contact and highly intuitive inspection method for mechanics to use before installation</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Iterative Refinement</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the design process, I iterated multiple geometries to calibrate the tool’s detection sensitivity. My first results achieved
      a 0.076" deviation detection down and the last ones a 0.010". I also investigated using <strong>optical lenses</strong> to focus the
      beam for tighter detection thresholds. All CAD modeling was performed in <strong>CATIA V5</strong>, and I created
      <strong>testing blocks</strong> to simulate the HUD template for bench testing prior to full-scale implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the initial design was validated virtually, I prepared the model for 3D printing to evaluate assembly alignment
      and beam behavior. Although the final machining phase was pending at the end of my internship, I documented a full
      <strong>continuation guide</strong> outlining dependent and independent variables, material considerations, and
      calibration methodology for the next engineer to take advantage of the momentum and carry the project forward.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome & Impact</h3>
    <p>
      The project demonstrated how <strong>optical inspection tools</strong> can be designed to achieve high accuracy while
      remaining lightweight and easy to use on the shop floor. It also gave me hands-on experience in tolerance stack-up
      analysis, fixture design, and DFM principles. Everything within the context of Boeing’s rigorous engineering environment, and a reach to perfection.

        <span class="tag">Design for Manufacturing (DFM)</span>
    </div>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      As part of Boeing’s 3-day BCA ONE Intern Design-A-Thon, I joined a team of three to tackle a challenge centered around
      improving the <strong>passenger flight experience</strong>. Our goal was to enhance comfort and convenience for economy-class passengers
      while ensuring airlines could adopt the design without major cost increases.
    </p>

    <p>
      After analyzing common passenger frustrations, we discovered that one of the most frequent (yet highly overlooked) issues comes
      from the <strong>economy seat tray’s cup holder</strong>. It’s often too shallow to actually hold drinks, causing spills and stress
      during turbulence. This creates a poor passenger experience and, in some cases, safety concerns from spilled hot beverages.
    </p>

    <h3>Concept Development</h3>
    <p>
      With that insight, we reimagined the existing seat tray by integrating a <strong>collapsible cup holder</strong> inspired by
      hiking and camping cup designs. The collapsible feature allows it to fit within the tray’s original dimensions when stowed,
      yet securely hold a range of drink sizes when deployed. This design not only prevents spills but also provides a containment
      area in case of minor leaks.
    </p>

    <p>
      We further improved usability by adding a small <strong>front tab</strong> that serves as a phone rest, allowing passengers to
      comfortably watch content, which aligns with airlines’ shift toward in-flight streaming services. The bottom of the
      collapsible holder can be <strong>customized with airline branding and colors</strong>, creating a new space for identity and
      personalization without additional parts or materials.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Strategy</h3>
    <p>
      One of our main constraints was ensuring the design remained <strong>retrofit-compatible</strong>. By maintaining the original
      tray dimensions and hinge system, airlines could easily replace existing trays with our new design once their current ones
      reach end-of-life, avoiding the need for large-scale retooling or redesign. This decision balanced <strong>innovation and
      practicality</strong>, making the design both attractive and feasible for manufacturers.
    </p>

    <h3>Prototyping & Results</h3>
    <p>
      Given the short timeline, we worked efficiently by brainstorming, designing, and fabricating a <strong>1:1 functional prototype</strong>
      within just a day and a half at Boeing’s Integration Center. The prototype showcased the collapsible mechanism, phone stand,
      and overall ergonomics of the design. We concluded the event by presenting our final concept to a panel of Boeing engineers
      and designers, earning <strong>2nd place</strong> in the competition for innovation and user-centered design.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This project reinforced the importance of <strong>balancing creativity with manufacturability</strong>. It also showed how
      user-centered thinking can uncover meaningful improvements in everyday designs, even in something as common as an airplane
      seat tray. Beyond the competition, this experience strengthened my skills in rapid ideation, teamwork, and communicating
      design intent under tight deadlines.

    </div>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      As part of the <strong>ASCEND Autonomous Systems Research Team</strong>, I was responsible for designing an
      <strong>avionics enclosure</strong> for our ATV’s critical flight electronics, including the Pixhawk flight
      controller, multiple Raspberry Pis, GPS module, and supporting communication interfaces. The primary goal
      was to develop a compact, modular, and EMI-protected housing that safeguarded sensitive electronics while
      fitting seamlessly within the limited space of the vehicle chassis.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      The enclosure had to satisfy multiple engineering constraints simultaneously: <strong>electromagnetic compatibility</strong> between
      high-frequency components (such as the Raspberry Pi) and navigation systems, <strong>thermal regulation</strong> to prevent overheating,
      <strong>structural integrity</strong> to withstand vibration and impact, and <strong>spatial efficiency</strong> to integrate within the ATV’s frame.
      Furthermore, each subsystem required clear wire routing and access for maintenance without compromising protection.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p>
      I began by modeling each electronic component in <strong>SolidWorks</strong> and mapping the physical wiring layout
      to ensure optimal cable management and clearance. The design evolved into a <strong>multi-compartment box</strong>,
      where each module—Pixhawk, Raspberry Pi, GPS, and power converters—occupied a dedicated block within the
      structure to minimize EMI coupling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The enclosure was constructed using <strong>laser-cut acrylic panels</strong> joined with a modified <strong>dovetail-style
      interlocking joint</strong> for added rigidity and ease of assembly. To facilitate airflow, I patterned two of the
      four sides with <strong>ventilation hole arrays</strong> sized to balance cooling and dust protection. The bottom
      panel was engraved with the <strong>wiring diagram layout</strong>, providing a built-in guide for organized cable
      routing and component placement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>top lid</strong> incorporated a raised GPS mounting tab to expose the antenna to open air—maintaining
      direct satellite visibility while keeping the rest of the electronics enclosed. This design choice preserved
      both performance and safety by isolating the GPS from EMI sources while optimizing reception.
    </p>

    <h3>Prototyping & Fabrication</h3>
    <p>
      Once the 3D model was validated through spatial fit checks, I exported the 2D profiles for laser cutting and
      assembled the prototype to verify dimensional accuracy and airflow effectiveness. The modular dovetail joints
      proved robust under vibration tests, while the engraved wiring map significantly streamlined installation and
      troubleshooting.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome & Impact</h3>
    <p>
      The final design provided a <strong>lightweight, EMI-resistant, and serviceable avionics housing</strong> that
      integrated seamlessly into the ASCEND ATV platform. It improved cable management efficiency, reduced EMI interference
      with the GPS subsystem, and enhanced airflow to maintain electronic reliability during extended testing sessions.
      The enclosure design has since been adopted as a <strong>standard reference architecture</strong> for future ASCEND vehicle builds,
      demonstrating a balance of precision engineering and practical manufacturability.

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      As part of the <strong>ASCEND Autonomous Systems Research Team</strong>, our group was tasked with transitioning our
      <strong>Autonomous Test Vehicle (ATV)</strong> from a gasoline-powered drivetrain to a fully electric propulsion system.
      This conversion was required by the university to allow experimental testing and research operations on the main campus,
      where the use of internal combustion engines was restricted for safety and environmental reasons.
    </p>

    <h3>Team Objective</h3>
    <p>
      Working as part of a <strong>three-person mechanical integration team</strong>, I helped lead the effort to
      <strong>remove the existing gas engine</strong> while maintaining the structural and electrical integrity of the platform.
      The objective was to prepare the vehicle chassis for the upcoming <strong>electric motor retrofit</strong>, ensuring that
      all components—fuel lines, throttle linkage, exhaust, and engine mounts—were safely extracted and documented for future
      reinstallation reference.
    </p>

    <h3>Process & Safety</h3>
    <p>
      The removal process began with a detailed system review of the ATV’s <strong>fuel and electrical subsystems</strong> to
      identify all active circuits and potential hazards. I assisted in <strong>depressurizing the fuel system</strong>,
      disconnecting the battery, and isolating all power sources prior to disassembly. We used <strong>tagout and labeling
      procedures</strong> to track every cable, bracket, and mounting bolt to maintain full traceability during the
      conversion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the engine assembly was disconnected, our team coordinated the mechanical removal using a hoist and custom sling
      setup to ensure even load distribution. After extraction, we performed a <strong>clean decontamination</strong> of the
      chassis to remove residual fuel and oil, making the frame safe for electronics installation.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome & Preparation for Electrification</h3>
    <p>
      The gas engine removal was successfully completed without any structural damage or contamination incidents. The cleaned
      and documented chassis was officially cleared for use in the <strong>electrification phase</strong> of the ASCEND project.
      This operation provided hands-on experience in <strong>mechanical teardown, safety planning, and cross-disciplinary
      coordination</strong>—essential skills for future vehicle design and propulsion research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond the technical accomplishment, the project marked a major milestone in ASCEND’s sustainability transition,
      paving the way for the development of a <strong>zero-emission test platform</strong> capable of campus-based autonomous
      experimentation.

          We began by researching available <strong>electric motors</strong> capable of providing sufficient power to 
          reach the ATV’s target speed of approximately <strong>30 mph</strong>. The challenge was identifying a model 
          that balanced performance, efficiency, and cost, while also complying with the <strong>UT campus safety 
          guidelines</strong> limiting us to a low-voltage configuration (four 5V batteries in parallel).
        </p>
    
        <p>
          After evaluating several commercial options, our team selected a compact brushed DC motor that met the 
          torque and speed requirements while remaining within the electrical and budget constraints. Once chosen, 
          we searched for compatible <strong>custom mounting brackets</strong> to secure the cylindrical motor in a flat, 
          stable orientation.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Design & Mounting Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          We explored multiple <strong>mounting configurations</strong> to integrate the motor within the limited space 
          of the ATV’s chassis. Early prototypes were constructed using <strong>cardboard and mockups</strong> to test 
          various orientations and attachment methods. However, during physical prototyping we discovered that several 
          of these designs interfered with the <strong>gear chain alignment</strong>, causing collisions with the ATV frame 
          due to insufficient height clearance.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          To overcome this, I proposed and helped develop a <strong>suspended motor mount system</strong> — a novel 
          approach that allowed the motor to hang securely from the frame rather than sit atop it. This configuration 
          freed up valuable interior space for critical components such as the <strong>motor controller, avionics, and 
          battery modules</strong>, while maintaining precise chain alignment and minimizing vibration.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Prototype & Structural Integration</h3>
        <p>
          The final design consisted of a pair of <strong>C-channel aluminum rails</strong> supporting the custom motor 
          plate. These rails acted like a <strong>drawer system</strong>, enabling slight sliding adjustment during alignment 
          and maintenance. During the initial prototype phase, the motor was temporarily supported with a <strong>steel 
          cable harness</strong> to test stability and clearance before committing to permanent fabrication.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Once the mechanical lead approved the concept, we planned the final integration process. Due to extreme space 
          limitations, traditional fasteners such as bolts and screws were impractical. Instead, we used a <strong>welded 
          reference plate</strong> to join the C-channels directly to the ATV frame. This method ensured the rails 
          remained perfectly parallel and rigid, maintaining the correct spacing for the motor mount while resisting 
          operational vibration.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Outcome & Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The implemented design provided a <strong>lightweight, compact, and serviceable solution</strong> for housing 
          the new electric motor. The suspended mounting system maximized frame space utilization, improved drivetrain 
          alignment, and simplified future maintenance and upgrades. Also, we tested our ATV to reach 20mph at 25% throttle,
            which leads us to believe we can achieve 40mph at full throttle!
        </p>
    
        <p>
          This project strengthened my experience in <strong>mechanical design under constraints, hands-on prototyping, 
          and systems integration</strong>. It also demonstrated how creative thinking — such as transforming a traditional 
          rigid mount into a suspended system — can turn space limitations into engineering innovation.

    </div>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Motivated by a deep curiosity for <strong>humanoid robotics</strong> and accessible engineering design,
      I initiated a self-driven project to create a <strong>3D-printed robotic hand</strong> that could be
      easily fabricated and adapted for use in <strong>assistive technology applications</strong>.
      The long-term vision is to share the design with <strong>ADAPT Texas</strong>, a student organization
      dedicated to developing custom-engineered devices for the disabled community at no cost.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Concept</h3>
    <p>
      The robotic hand was modeled entirely in <strong>OnShape</strong> using a biomimetic design approach inspired
      by the human hand’s tendon-driven motion. Instead of using rigid linkages, I implemented <strong>fishing line–based
      tendon cables</strong> routed through each finger and anchored to a bar at the fingertip. This design allows the
      fingers to flex and retract naturally, replicating the curling motion of human digits when tensioned.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first design iteration placed all <strong>actuators within the palm</strong>, directly controlling the cable
      tension for each finger. However, during mechanical testing and CAD analysis, I found that this configuration
      compromised the palm’s strength and internal space. To improve load distribution and durability, I relocated
      the actuators to the <strong>forearm assembly</strong>, which not only enhanced structural integrity but also
      freed up space for future sensor integration and improved wiring management.
    </p>

    <h3>Engineering Development</h3>
    <p>
      The current CAD assembly includes all mechanical linkages, cable routing paths, and potential mounting points
      for electronics and actuators. My ongoing research focuses on <strong>sensor integration</strong> to enable
      tactile feedback and position control, with candidates including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Load cells</strong> for force feedback at fingertip joints</li>
      <li><strong>Potentiometers</strong> to measure angular displacement</li>
      <li><strong>EMG (electromyography) sensors</strong> for detecting muscle signals from the user</li>
      <li><strong>Temperature sensors</strong> for thermal sensitivity applications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Beyond the hardware, the design requires careful <strong>material selection</strong> to balance strength,
      flexibility, and affordability. I have been experimenting with PLA and TPU for the joints and tendons, respectively,
      to emulate human biomechanics while maintaining accessibility for low-cost fabrication.
    </p>

    <h3>Research Challenges & Future Work</h3>
    <p>
      This project has involved extensive research into <strong>actuator placement trade-offs</strong>,
      <strong>space constraints</strong>, and the <strong>integration of sensors into small-scale mechanisms</strong>.
      The goal is to develop a platform that bridges robotics research and real-world assistive design —
      one that can be customized, printed, and assembled by students and engineers seeking to create affordable
      prosthetic or robotic systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome & Impact</h3>
    <p>
      The project is still in active development, but it has already provided valuable insights into mechanical
      design optimization, additive manufacturing techniques, and human–machine interaction principles. By open-sourcing
      the final design to <strong>ADAPT Texas</strong>, this robotic hand aims to serve as both a <strong>teaching
      platform</strong> for engineering students and a <strong>functional assistive device prototype</strong> that
      promotes accessibility and inclusivity through engineering innovation.

    </div>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      As the final project for my <strong>Robotic Mechanism Design</strong> course, our team was challenged to design
      and prototype a complex linkage mechanism capable of producing a controlled and purposeful motion. We developed a
      <strong>mini bowling table game</strong> driven by a four-bar linkage that mimicked the coordinated motion of a
      human bowler’s arm and wrist — combining spin, flick, and follow-through motions to accurately launch a miniature
      bowling ball toward the pins.
    </p>

    <h3>Concept & Design Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      We began by studying the biomechanics of a bowling throw and translating those into mechanical linkages that could
      achieve similar kinematic profiles. Using <strong>MotionGen</strong>, we modeled and optimized linkage dimensions
      to replicate the spin and whip action seen in a bowler’s arm. Our final design satisfied the <strong>Grashof
      condition</strong> for continuous motion and maintained a <strong>1-DoF configuration</strong>, ensuring that a single
      rotary input could drive the entire throwing motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mechanism’s geometry was tuned to convert the crank rotation into a realistic curved trajectory at the end-effector,
      producing a consistent “release” point with angular acceleration suitable for accurate bowling throws.
    </p>

    <h3>Mathematical & Simulation Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      To validate the theoretical design, we performed a full <strong>kinematic analysis</strong> in MATLAB. By solving the
      geometric constraint equations of the four-bar linkage, we simulated and animated the motion profile, confirming the
      expected combination of spin and whip dynamics. We also analyzed the <strong>position, velocity, and acceleration</strong>
      of the linkage’s tip — the point representing the “hand” of the bowler — to confirm a smooth release curve and proper
      timing for the flick motion.
    </p>

    <h3>Actuation & Control</h3>
    <p>
      The linkage was powered by a <strong>rotary actuator</strong> programmed to complete exactly one revolution per button
      press. This ensured that each throw was consistent and that the system would reset automatically for the next bowl.
      Adjusting the actuator’s speed allowed us to control the throwing strength while maintaining mechanical safety.
    </p>

    <h3>“Smile & Frown” Release Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
      To accurately replicate the human wrist flick, we designed a custom <strong>scoop-shaped end effector</strong>,
      nicknamed the <strong>“Smile & Frown”</strong>. The scoop’s rear section followed a concave “smile” <code>)</code> profile
      that held the bowling ball securely, while the front “frown” <code>(</code> curve released the ball at the precise
      moment of maximum angular velocity. The design followed an <strong>inverse ramp profile</strong> to delay release
      until optimal momentum was achieved, ensuring smooth and consistent throws.
    </p>

    <h3>Fabrication & Material Selection</h3>
    <p>
      The prototype was constructed using a combination of <strong>laser-cut acrylic</strong> and <strong>wood</strong> for
      structural balance and surface optimization. The <strong>linkages</strong> and the top surface of the bowling alley were
      laser-cut from acrylic to take advantage of its <strong>low friction coefficient</strong> compared to wood, allowing
      the ball to roll smoothly with minimal resistance. The <strong>base</strong> of the bowling lane was made from wood
      to provide better <strong>stability, vibration damping, and support</strong> for the entire setup.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bowling lane also featured a <strong>built-in gutter system</strong> to prevent the ball from leaving the track,
      improving playability and experimental consistency. Finally, the <strong>pins were 3D printed</strong> using a Raise3D
      printer, allowing for uniform geometry and scalable replication for future class projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome & Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      The final mechanism successfully reproduced the combined spin and flick motion of a human bowler. The simulated
      results aligned closely with physical testing, validating both the mathematical model and fabrication accuracy.
      The system’s repeatable control and realistic motion made it one of the most dynamic mechanisms in the course.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project strengthened my understanding of <strong>kinematic synthesis, mechanical actuation, and material-based
      design decisions</strong>. It was also an excellent demonstration of how theory, simulation, and fabrication can
      integrate to produce a precise and engaging robotic mechanism.

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      As part of the <strong>Robotic Mechanism Design</strong> course, my team, <strong>“The Decepticons”</strong>,
      was challenged to design and build a <strong>remote-controlled vehicle</strong> using a set of two powered actuators
      and one non-actuated wheel. The project combined <strong>mechanical design, circuit integration, and programming</strong>
      to develop a functional RC car capable of both manual and autonomous motion.
    </p>

    <h3>Mechanical Design</h3>
    <p>
      Our first step was to model the <strong>vehicle chassis</strong> in <strong>SolidWorks</strong>, ensuring it provided
      adequate space for the motors, control board, and battery pack while maintaining a lightweight structure for
      efficient motion. The design included precise cutouts for wiring and wheel placement, as well as a flat upper deck
      for mounting electronics.
    </p>

    <p>
      To personalize our build, we incorporated the <strong>Decepticons logo</strong> into the chassis design, which became
      both a visual centerpiece and a representation of our team’s identity. Once finalized, the chassis was
      <strong>laser-cut from acrylic</strong> for high dimensional accuracy and durability, providing a clean, transparent
      look that showcased the internal electronics.
    </p>

    <h3>Electrical & Control System</h3>
    <p>
      We designed and assembled the <strong>electrical circuit</strong> responsible for driving the two actuator-powered
      wheels. The system included a <strong>microcontroller board</strong>, <strong>motor drivers</strong>, and a compact
      <strong>power distribution layout</strong> to ensure stable operation under load.
    </p>

    <p>
      For control, we programmed the system to operate in two modes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Manual Mode:</strong> Controlled via a <strong>joystick interface</strong>, allowing direct control over steering and acceleration.</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomous Mode:</strong> Pre-programmed to <strong>drive in continuous circles</strong> using a fixed control algorithm that modulated wheel speeds asymmetrically.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We tuned the actuation timing and response curves to ensure stable circular motion and prevent slippage during turns.
      The circuit was compact, modular, and easy to reconfigure for future testing or additional sensors.
    </p>

    <h3>Fabrication & Assembly</h3>
    <p>
      The entire structure was <strong>laser-cut from acrylic sheets</strong> and assembled using friction-fit tabs and
      fasteners. This approach allowed easy maintenance and rapid iteration during testing. The acrylic chassis not only
      provided a professional finish but also allowed us to visualize and debug the electronic connections in real time.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome & Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      The final RC car successfully met all project requirements and exceeded expectations with its reliable circular motion
      and responsive joystick control. The integrated design showcased a complete <strong>mechatronic system</strong> —
      blending mechanical CAD modeling, electrical integration, and control programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project deepened my understanding of <strong>motor control systems, mechanical–electrical co-design,
      and real-time motion tuning</strong>. It also emphasized the value of teamwork and creativity in engineering design,
      especially when transforming basic components into a fully functional and interactive robotic system.

    </div>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      As part of a hands-on module in <strong>Robotic Mechanism Design</strong>, I constructed a
      <strong>slider-crank mechanism</strong> capable of manually lifting a one-pound weight. The purpose of this project
      was to explore the <strong>mechanical efficiency and motion transfer</strong> of simple linkages and understand
      the inherent limitations and inefficiencies that arise in real-world assembly.
    </p>

    <h3>Design & Objective</h3>
    <p>
      The task focused on creating a functional slider-crank system that could be <strong>actuated by hand</strong>
      while maintaining minimal <strong>joint play and frictional losses</strong>. I designed the linkage to demonstrate
      how small imperfections or tolerances could amplify motion irregularities, providing a tangible understanding of
      why precision alignment and stiffness are critical in practical mechanism design.
    </p>

    <h3>Performance & Optimization</h3>
    <p>
      After assembling and calibrating the system, we achieved <strong>smooth, consistent motion</strong> with
      remarkably low mechanical backlash. By carefully selecting pivot clearances and verifying alignment through
      iterative fitting, we reduced unwanted vibration and achieved a rigid transmission of force, which allowed the hand-actuated
      crank to efficiently lift the 1 lb load with minimal slippage.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome & Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      While simple in construction, the project highlighted the <strong>trade-offs between theoretical linkage efficiency
      and real-world mechanical losses</strong>. It reinforced the importance of material rigidity, tolerance matching,
      and proper joint design in mechanical systems. This exercise served as a practical foundation for more complex
      linkage projects like the <strong>Mini Bowling Game</strong>, where dynamic forces and motion precision became key.
